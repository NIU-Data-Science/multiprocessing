This repository provides small code snippets to identify challenges with various operating systems using Python's
multiprocessing and pathos library.

The goal is to identify where and when the code works and if it may work differently on different computers with the 
same OS.

Please run the codes and add your results to the discussion or if you want to give pull requests a try update the readme
and do a pull request.
